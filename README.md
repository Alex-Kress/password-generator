## Project Description

This website was created by adding Javascript to pre-exsting HTML and CSS.

The added Javascript identified array variables to allow the password to contain the various types of characters.  It also added pop-up windows to the website so that when the user clicks the generate button, the following takes place:

The user is prompted to input the number of characters they want their password to contain, in a prompt window.

The user then indicates which types of characters they want used, through a series of four confirm windows that pop up.

Once this is completed, the generatePassword function uses if functions and a for loop to generate the password, and the user is able to see their password displayed in a box on the main page of the website.
